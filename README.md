# Machine Learning Projects

# To, All The Intended Audiences:
Human beings can extend their awareness to adapt to changing environments. For that to happen, they start "learning". While learning is a simple task for most humans, it is too difficult and complicated for machines to gain new information or skills from data. In fact, a machine's level of knowledge is directly related to its capacity to understand. Machine learning tries to overcome this difficult mission. In other terms, machine learning is the artificial intelligence division that tries to find a answer to this question: How to allow computer to to do the learning?

### Machine Learning 
When we claim the computer is learning, we assume the system will infer from examples of ideal actions or previous experiences and knowledge. More formal definition of machine learning by Tom Mitchell is A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. As a part of my learning process, I thought to share the knowledge and my approaches in this field with everyone.

### This repo will contain popular topics of my Machine Learning Lab with Examples for each of them. Few of them are pointed out as follows:
Below are the list of ML Lab Works : 
- Lab 01 : Starting Data Analyis, Reading Data and Simple Visualizations
- Lab 02 : Supervised Learning with the following constraints:
  - Demonstrate Naive Bayes Classifier for nominal Data.
  - Demonstrate Naive Bayes Classifier for numeric Data.
  - Demonstrate error using any three metrics and two plots.
- Lab 03:  Demonstrate K Means Algorithm, while including the following components : 
  - At least one plot to visualize the results. 
  - Elbow method for choosing optimum number of clusters.
  - At least one metric for the evaluation of the quality of obtained clusters.
- Lab 04:  Demonstrate PCA for dimensionality reduction for image data with :
  - Demonstrate application of the reduced data for visualization.
  - Demonstrate the process using number of components and percentage of variance as criteria for obtaining the reduced dataset.
- Lab 05:  Demonstration of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for Dimensionality Reduction

  (More Will Be Added Soon)
